# MemoryAssistant

An AI-powered memory interface that helps organize and recall personal history, structured around cognition, care, and humane interaction. Inspired by real-world caregiving needs.

## What it Does
- Connects scanned letters, photos, family tree, and a timeline of life events
- Uses local + cloud AI models to assist with recall
- Built with real users in mind — not just tech demos

## Interaction

MemoryAssistant is designed for non-traditional input — a custom physical interface tailored for accessibility and clarity. Current development uses a modular control deck for prototyping.


## Tech Stack
Python · SQLite · Flask · Ollama · OpenAI · Stream Deck · OCR
